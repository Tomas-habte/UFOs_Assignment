# UFOs Assignment
## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to apply filters on a table. We are able to accomplish this by creating a dynamic webpage with HTML and Bootstrap. 
## Results
The end result is a simple webpage where you will first see all the UFO sightings listed on the right and the filter search options on the left.

You can then filter by date, city, state, country or shape. You can also use multiple filters at the same time. Below is an example of what you see if you filter for a triangle shaped UFO in New York State.

## Summary

A drawback of this webpage is that there is no button which removes all the filters applied so you have to first remove each filter individually before you apply a different filter. This drawback could be overcome by adding a button called "Reset Filter" on the webpage. Here are two additional recommendations for further development:
- Add autocomplete search suggestions for all except the filter date
- Add a scroll-to-top button since the list is long
